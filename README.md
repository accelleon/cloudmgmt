# Cloud Management
A Python/PostgreSQL/VueJS project meant to be the base to fork a private internal centralized dashboard.

Core frameworks and libraries were chosen to achieve the absolute quickest time to develop:
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- Alembic
- Quasar

## TODO
- Set up Traefik and Docker
- Set up CI
- Implement Celery to handle long running tasks
- Implement a Redis database
